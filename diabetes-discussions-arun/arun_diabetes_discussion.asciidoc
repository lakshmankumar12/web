11/20/19, 10:24 PM - Arun M: Btw, my latest interest is in keto diet.. have started strictly over last one week and am already noticing positive changes in my body..
11/20/19, 10:25 PM - Arun M: Has anyone here given it a try ?
11/20/19, 10:25 PM - Arun M: Yes
11/20/19, 10:28 PM - Arun M: As of now
11/20/19, 10:28 PM - Arun M: Stopped sugar intake on any form
11/20/19, 10:29 PM - Arun M: Stopped main sources of carb like rice wheat etc etc
11/20/19, 10:29 PM - Arun M: Eggs, non veg, coconut , nuts , green veggies
11/20/19, 10:30 PM - Arun M: My rice replacement is cabbage or cauliflower chopped
11/20/19, 10:32 PM - Arun M: Nattu kozhi, muttton, fish in alternate fashion...
11/20/19, 10:32 PM - Arun M: Using coconut oil for cooking
11/20/19, 10:36 PM - Arun M: Post Diwali ??
11/20/19, 10:36 PM - Arun M: I am not eating raw veggies.. cooked only but the only the  green non starchy ones
11/20/19, 10:38 PM - Arun M: Ok..
11/20/19, 10:40 PM - Arun M: I have listened to lots of videos on this topic and now can say fairly conclusively that stopping carbs atleast from time to time is a great idea to cleanse/ reset the body
11/20/19, 10:41 PM - Arun M: Stopped for now . I am planning to do the strict diet for atleast 3 months and then see
11/20/19, 10:43 PM - Arun M: As a quick intro - body basically runs in glucose all our life since 70% carb is norm for most
11/20/19, 10:45 PM - Arun M: This keeps insulin high always.. high insulin levels for decades leads to something called insulin resistance which in turn leads to a myriad of lifestyle diseases , most importantly diabetes
11/20/19, 10:46 PM - Arun M: Going to very low carb diet, high fat diet  shifts the body into ketosis.
11/20/19, 10:46 PM - Arun M: Here, body runs in ketones ..
11/20/19, 10:47 PM - Arun M: If you do this for a month or so, insulin resistance comes down automatically for most PPL.. as if body has been given breathing time to solve itself
11/20/19, 10:48 PM - Arun M: I will come back with my own findings with my body after a few weeks..
11/20/19, 10:53 PM - Arun M: I did it quite abruptly da.. had headach for few days.. now no issues, body got adjusted.. anyway will see how it goes ..
11/20/19, 10:53 PM - Arun M: Yes da.. not advisable if you want to achieve ketosis..
11/20/19, 10:55 PM - Arun M: Maybe.. i will see..
11/20/19, 10:56 PM - Arun M: Btw, the keto or LCHF diet is slowly gaining prominence in medical community world wide.. lots of positive stuff like diabetes reversal, cholesterol, no reversal and so on
11/20/19, 10:59 PM - Arun M: Difficult to know long term impact since it is relatively new , but lots of promise..
11/20/19, 11:03 PM - Arun M: You mean he went on keto and now is unable to eat carbs ??
11/20/19, 11:04 PM - Arun M: But did he replace with fats ?
11/20/19, 11:05 PM - Arun M: PPL do keto diet without understanding and get into trouble
11/20/19, 11:06 PM - Arun M: Ok ..
11/20/19, 11:12 PM - Arun M: After lots of researching, i view keto diet not as a weight loss tool, but a body cleansing/ resetting  mechanism. Weight loss is a good side effect
11/20/19, 11:17 PM - Arun M: Also, guys - many of u do annual health checkups right..
11/20/19, 11:18 PM - Arun M: A really important parameter to check is fasting insulin , which is not done anywhere .. they only check blood glucose
11/20/19, 11:19 PM - Arun M: But high fasting insulin means you are pre- diabetic already..
11/20/19, 11:19 PM - Arun M: Next time you do checkup, ask for fasting insulin to be done
11/20/19, 11:20 PM - Arun M: If high, start dietary changes
11/20/19, 11:21 PM - Arun M: Good start will be to reduce the food intake to 3 times a day and avoid sugar complete ly..
11/20/19, 11:21 PM - Arun M: Typical person has 5 to 6 intake of carbs everyday..  sureshot way to insulin resistance
11/20/19, 11:22 PM - Arun M: Ok , have to sleep now..
11/20/19, 11:22 PM - Arun M: If anyone is interested , i can share more later
11/20/19, 11:23 PM - Arun M: https://youtu.be/OlKDM3SDHPA
11/21/19, 7:45 AM - Arun M: Yeah, i have been able to convince her and she has agreed to my 3 month experiment
11/21/19, 7:45 AM - Arun M: Others are eating normal stuff only
11/21/19, 7:47 AM - Arun M: Yes da .. but i try to not be too fussy ..
11/21/19, 7:47 AM - Arun M: She boils cauliflower or cabbage and that is my rice
11/21/19, 7:48 AM - Arun M: And she makes ok ne non veg daily for me
11/21/19, 7:48 AM - Arun M: Actually, that's the interesting aspect of this diet ..
11/21/19, 7:49 AM - Arun M: You have cravings for 3 to 4 days max after switch..
11/21/19, 7:49 AM - Arun M: I had headaches daily for first 4 days
11/21/19, 7:50 AM - Arun M: Insulin drives up hunger and in a non carb based diet, insulin secretion is very low
11/21/19, 7:50 AM - Arun M: With no insulin, hunger and cravings come down automatically
11/21/19, 7:51 AM - Arun M: Now, i am on 3 meals and absolutely no hunger in between
11/21/19, 7:51 AM - Arun M: No snacks, no coffee ,vtea anything
11/21/19, 7:51 AM - Arun M: Headaches stopped and i am feeling pretty good
11/21/19, 7:53 AM - Arun M: Non veg is mostly fat and some protein da .. same with eggs .. and nuts , and coconut
11/21/19, 7:54 AM - Arun M: My morning bkfast is 2 eggs with a badam - coconut shake ( no sugar)
11/21/19, 7:55 AM - Arun M: No milk da - decent carbs in it ..
11/21/19, 7:55 AM - Arun M: Yogurt with food i take
11/21/19, 7:57 AM - Arun M: Illa da .. i dont see much relation
11/21/19, 7:59 AM - Arun M: The good thing about carbs in veggies is the amount of fibre, so net carbs is carbs - fibre , so normal quantities are ok
11/21/19, 8:03 AM - Arun M: Yes, i am starting to see that difference too. I used to take a small 10 min nap after lunch since i used to feel sleepy .. but i am no longer needing it..
11/21/19, 8:04 AM - Arun M: And my weight is 2 kg down over last one week
11/21/19, 8:05 AM - Arun M: With no calorie reduction whatsoever.. infact it might have gone up
11/21/19, 8:05 AM - Arun M: Insulin is the main culprit
11/21/19, 8:05 AM - Arun M: It is an anabolic enzyme
11/21/19, 8:06 AM - Arun M: All fat burning mechanisms stop in presense of insulin
11/21/19, 8:07 AM - Arun M: For PPL with insulin resistance, body starts to prioritise fat storage compared to giving energy to cells
11/21/19, 8:07 AM - Arun M: No way to get body weight down with high levels of insulin in body
11/21/19, 8:08 AM - Arun M: And for men in particular, the fat is visceral in general as opposed to sub cutaneous in women
11/21/19, 8:08 AM - Arun M: visceral fat leads to bulging waist and is a cardio vascular risk
11/21/19, 8:09 AM - Arun M: Men genetically are bad in that aspect
11/21/19, 8:09 AM - Arun M: Sun cutaneous fat doesn't do much damage, but visceral fat does
11/21/19, 8:09 AM - Arun M: Men more prone to heart attacks
11/21/19, 8:11 AM - Arun M: How to observe - if tummy is flabby, it is subcutaneous, if it's more rounded and firm, it is visceral
11/21/19, 8:14 AM - Arun M: Hmm. That's a bit difficult da.. i haven't looked up much , but YouTube has lots of recipes.. butter , ghee inclusion must
11/21/19, 8:15 AM - Arun M: Panneer and cheese also
11/21/19, 8:16 AM - Arun M: Yes da.. and no snacks and no sugar based stuff
11/21/19, 8:19 AM - Arun M: Most low calorie / high exercise regimen of dieting fail in long term since it is difficult to control cravings. In long term , i a battle of will power vs body, body always wins
11/21/19, 8:19 AM - Arun M: That's why you need to keep the body what it wants and it will be happy
11/21/19, 8:23 AM - Arun M: Yes da.. do you feel hungry 3 hrs after eating ? Is your hunger in general normal or is it tearing you down ? Are you craving for sugar ? Is your waist going up ? Do you feel drowsy after meal ? These indicate insulin resistance
11/21/19, 8:23 AM - Arun M: There is one more important phenomenon with age and sedentary lifestyle
11/21/19, 8:23 AM - Arun M: Called metabolic rate
11/21/19, 8:24 AM - Arun M: It's the rate if energy usage by body
11/21/19, 8:24 AM - Arun M: In general you want to keep metabolic rate high
11/21/19, 8:24 AM - Arun M: It is high in young PPL
11/21/19, 8:26 AM - Arun M: But body being an intelligent machine, learns about our habits over time . How much are we eating, are we mostly sedentary
11/21/19, 8:26 AM - Arun M: Then it down regulates the metabolic rate
11/21/19, 8:27 AM - Arun M: Let's say our metabolic rate was 2000 cal per day when young
11/21/19, 8:27 AM - Arun M: Body slowly starts down regulating to let's say 1500 over time
11/21/19, 8:29 AM - Arun M: Earlier if u ate 2100, you will gain weight
11/21/19, 8:29 AM - Arun M: Now, with 1600 you will gain weight
11/21/19, 8:30 AM - Arun M: The downside is less energy available.
11/21/19, 8:30 AM - Arun M: Thats why calorie restricting diets are bad in long term, your metabolic rate comes down
11/21/19, 8:31 AM - Arun M: Now if you restrict diet further, it will come down further , to let's say 1000
11/21/19, 8:31 AM - Arun M: There is no end
11/21/19, 8:33 AM - Arun M: There is this biggest loser show in US right ? Most PPL gain back the weight lost in next 2 years
11/21/19, 8:33 AM - Arun M: PPL studied this and found metabolic rate has gone down in these PPL , so inspite of less intake they get fatter eventually..
11/21/19, 8:34 AM - Arun M: We can't fight body - that's the bottom line
11/21/19, 8:48 AM - Arun M: Oddly enough, this viscious cycle is absent in ketosis... If you stop carbs, and eat 2500 cal per day also, it is very difficult to gain weight
11/21/19, 8:48 AM - Arun M: Looks like keto diet amps up our metabolic rate
11/21/19, 8:49 AM - Arun M: Almost everyone on this diet feel to have more energy than earlier -- means their metabolic rate has gone up
11/21/19, 9:49 AM - Arun M: Aamaam da.. lots of fads come in diet since benefits are not easily quantifiable and doesn't work on broad set of PPL
11/21/19, 9:49 AM - Arun M: But i think this one is here to stay..
11/21/19, 9:50 AM - Arun M: Dr's world over have slowly woken up to this fact and so called incurable lifestyle diseases are getting reversed at a really high success rate
11/21/19, 9:50 AM - Arun M: UK Govt has put LCHF diet as a solution for diabetes
11/21/19, 9:51 AM - Arun M: American diabetes association has acknowledged the LCHF  diet as having great impact
11/21/19, 9:52 AM - Arun M: After seeing tons of evidence over last 10 yrs on the internet, i am fairly convinced that this will become the norm over time
11/21/19, 9:53 AM - Arun M: I shared a ppt by Dr. Unwin. He is one of the Drs who did pioneering work on this and was instrumental in convincing UK health ministry to revise its dietary guidelines
11/21/19, 9:54 AM - Arun M: He created a silent revolution with his patients and meticulously documented all data to show proof
11/21/19, 9:59 AM - Arun M: All Drs who have tried this on patients regret not doing this from earlier times and that they have been so blind to the monster which is Insulin resistance
11/21/19, 10:04 AM - Arun M: I likethis analogy: assume our body is a car runing in diesel (carbs) over long time , but we never serviced it ..
11/21/19, 10:05 AM - Arun M: But actually our car is a hybrid which can also run on electricity (fat). Let's say we start using only electricity for few months
11/21/19, 10:06 AM - Arun M: The great thing about our car is that, if we let itbe without work it does self servicing
11/21/19, 10:06 AM - Arun M: So after 3 months, ur diesel engines have come back to great shape
11/21/19, 10:07 AM - Arun M: Now , it's up to you to run your car in electric or diesel , depending on your preference after that
11/21/19, 2:59 PM - Arun M: Yeah, you are right.  it's not by UK GOVT. It's only by PHCUK.

5/8/20, 1:43 PM - Arun M: https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/cost-diabetes
5/8/20, 1:43 PM - Arun M: Some stats
5/8/20, 1:44 PM - Arun M: https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm
5/8/20, 1:45 PM - Arun M: One more big expense which is happening is the money spent on ppl just before death.. almost everyone dies at hospital nowadays
5/8/20, 1:48 PM - Arun M: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170214162750.htm
5/8/20, 2:25 PM - Arun M: diet guidelines
1. Reduce sugar/ products with sugar(less than 2 spoons or 10 gm equivalent)  , fruits in moderation is ok
2. Avoid processed foods (easy way to identify is anything which is packed and sold)
3. Eat less times a day (3 is good, 2 is very good)
4. reduce refined carbs (luke polished rice, wheat etc)
5. avoid deep fried items (samosa/ puff etc)
6. avoid eating carbs and fats in the same meal as much as possible
7. avoid snacking , but if needed, keep healthy options handy (like nuts)
8. take vit d supplements. for vegetarians, b12 is also needed
5/8/20, 2:25 PM - Arun M: I made this list and use it as rough guideline
5/8/20, 2:26 PM - Arun M: The items are in order of priority
5/8/20, 2:32 PM - Arun M: For many it's a hormonal thing, hyper-insulinimea is there in around 50% of us
----

5/9/20, 8:53 AM - Arun M: 1. once a week indulgence is fine da
5/9/20, 8:54 AM - Arun M: 4. try millets instead of rice (we use it regularly here)
5/9/20, 8:56 AM - Arun M: 6. carbs lead to insulin spikes. Insulin is growth hormone and it puts body into fat storing mode. Whenever we have carbs and fats together, the fats are packed up and stored readily due to excess insulin
5/9/20, 8:56 AM - Arun M: Fats only doesn't cause this problem since insulin secretion is negligible and the fat gets used up for energy
5/9/20, 8:58 AM - Arun M: 8.supplements -  I have looked at 100s of blood profiles da ( i am in a Facebook group which gives diet suggestions and asks for blood profiles of ppl). Out of 100 , only 1 or 2 have correct Vitamin D levels and around 10% have correct vit B12 levels
5/9/20, 8:59 AM - Arun M: Since most of us can't take enough sunlight naturally, we have to take Vit D
5/9/20, 9:01 AM - Arun M: examples for 6. biriyani , chicken with chappathi, chicken burger or sandwich and so on
5/9/20, 9:04 AM - Arun M: first we need to understand whether our hunger is emotional or actual. Many of us have become insensitive to whether our mind or body is asking for food
5/9/20, 9:05 AM - Arun M: once we understand it is mind, then we can slowly eliminate with will power
5/9/20, 9:05 AM - Arun M: but if it is real hunger, then its something we can't do much about. Only option is to have some healthy snack handy
5/9/20, 9:06 AM - Arun M: But frequent hunger itself is typically due to hyper-insulinemia. This can be sorted out by going to a low carb food for few months. I had this problem, but its now resolved
5/9/20, 11:53 AM - Arun M: Yes, better to avoid.
5/9/20, 11:55 AM - Arun M: Processed food create lsva different problem - our body gets confused (literally) since it doesn't understand what it is digesting. So enzymes are secreted wrongly which over long time leads to various complications
5/9/20, 12:05 PM - Arun M: Yes da.. sure, I was only talking about diet
5/9/20, 12:06 PM - Arun M: With respect to exercise, 3 days cardio (run, sports ) and 3 days muscle strengthening is optimum
5/9/20, 12:08 PM - Arun M: But the thing to remember is exercise should not be considered a weight loss tool. It's for overall health .
5/9/20, 12:10 PM - Arun M: I am noticing I normally put on weight (marginally) when I do strength training vs remaining idle
5/9/20, 12:11 PM - Arun M: I guess it's coming from muscle weight gain
----

5/10/20, 6:54 AM - Arun M: We are ok as long as the ratio is skewed one way or other like 80 /20 or so
5/10/20, 6:55 AM - Arun M: Butter on bread is fine if butter layer is thin
5/10/20, 6:56 AM - Arun M: We need to be wary of 50 50 ratios like roti with panneer butter masala types
5/10/20, 7:02 AM - Arun M: Also some ppl are more fat adapted than others.. the fat adapted ppl typically don't have bulging bellies..
5/10/20, 7:02 AM - Arun M: There is more leeway for these ppl
5/10/20, 7:02 AM - Arun M: If we have bulging bellies, it means our body is shoving fats around liver, pancreas etc. Then we need to be more careful
5/10/20, 7:03 AM - Arun M: They can also go for a 3 months servicing - low carb diet
5/10/20, 7:04 AM - Arun M: This makes them fat adapted and the belly fat dissolves in no time
5/10/20, 7:05 AM - Arun M: Our body doesn't like visceral fat and uses it immediately once we give a chance
5/10/20, 7:08 AM - Arun M: I would say if we are metabolically healthy, point 6 is not a must. Avoiding sugar / processed food is sufficient
5/10/20, 12:34 PM - Arun M: It needs a long answer, will try to make it brief
5/10/20, 12:34 PM - Arun M: Carb metabolism needs the assistance of insulin hormone, while fats don't
5/10/20, 12:35 PM - Arun M: And body prefers carb as fuel source if both are available
5/10/20, 12:36 PM - Arun M: In normal scenario, we eat carb + fat diet and insulin is secreted due to carbs
5/10/20, 12:36 PM - Arun M: Now, insulin is a master growth hormone which does a lot of things
5/10/20, 12:36 PM - Arun M: In  carb context, it pushes the glucose (end product of carbs) into cells and liver to reduce blood sugar level.
5/10/20, 12:37 PM - Arun M: This is a really important function and our body keeps the sugar under control , come what may
5/10/20, 12:37 PM - Arun M: the amount of insulin needed to do this job varies from person to person
5/10/20, 12:38 PM - Arun M: This is called 'insulin sensitivity'
5/10/20, 12:38 PM - Arun M: As we age, our insulin sensitivity goes down , meaning we need higher and higher insulin for the same amount of glucose
5/10/20, 12:39 PM - Arun M: So, the insulin spike after a meal increases with age.
5/10/20, 12:39 PM - Arun M: Second factor is called basal insulin, which is the average insulin when we are in fasting state
5/10/20, 12:39 PM - Arun M: This level should be close to zero in a healthy individual
5/10/20, 12:40 PM - Arun M: But with age, and also if we have a habit of eating frequently, due to multiple insulin spikes, the basal level doesn't go down to zero
5/10/20, 12:41 PM - Arun M: This starts creating a new problem.
5/10/20, 12:41 PM - Arun M: Now, lets say we eat a breakfast of eggs only
5/10/20, 12:41 PM - Arun M: this doesn't contain any carbs, only fats and protein
5/10/20, 12:42 PM - Arun M: but since basal insulin is non-zero, it suppresses the usage of fats for energy.
5/10/20, 12:42 PM - Arun M: Insulin, being a growth hormone prioritises fat for storage and not as fuel source
5/10/20, 12:43 PM - Arun M: Now, the fats get packed and promptly moved to fat cells , while we would not get the energy which is expected from a breakfast
5/10/20, 12:43 PM - Arun M: To have energy - either glucose or triglycerides (end product of fat metabolism) has to go into cells
5/10/20, 12:44 PM - Arun M: This person is called 'non-fat adapted'
5/10/20, 12:45 PM - Arun M: now, over time, both the peak insulin and basal insulin tend to increase as a positive feedback since our body cells develop a condition called insulin resistance (they need more and more insulin)
5/10/20, 12:46 PM - Arun M: Low carb diet is basically used to break this positive feedback
5/10/20, 12:46 PM - Arun M: Once we start low carb, then first what happens is the reserve glucose (stored in liver and muscles) get used up first
5/10/20, 12:46 PM - Arun M: typically, the reserve glucose lasts for a day only
5/10/20, 12:47 PM - Arun M: After this, if we still don't eat carbs, the body has no option, and insulin also starts going down
5/10/20, 12:47 PM - Arun M: Now, slowly, the metabolism switches towards fat as energy source
5/10/20, 12:48 PM - Arun M: This switch takes around a week time.. our body still craves for carbs and we become hungry, develop headaches and so on
5/10/20, 12:49 PM - Arun M: But after a week or so, slowly body gets used to burning fat as fuel.
5/10/20, 12:49 PM - Arun M: Now, the advantage with moving over to fat metabolism is the reserve storage of fat in our body
5/10/20, 12:49 PM - Arun M: For a normal human, 60 to 90 days of reserve is there as fat
5/10/20, 12:50 PM - Arun M: So, hunger and the need to eat more comes down drastically over time.
5/10/20, 12:50 PM - Arun M: Body doesn't care whether we eat any more since it has a big reserve storage to dip into
5/10/20, 12:51 PM - Arun M: If we do this for few months, the insulin resistance problem slowly goes away since the positive feedback is broken
5/10/20, 12:52 PM - Arun M: Now , after 3 months, even if we start eating carbs again
5/10/20, 12:52 PM - Arun M: the insulin level is much lower than earlier and hence body still retains the ability to use fat as fuel
5/10/20, 12:53 PM - Arun M: The 60 days reserve store is a evolutionary mechanism developed as a survival tool in human body
5/10/20, 12:53 PM - Arun M: but now it has become a liability in this day and age when we only overeat, never undereat
5/10/20, 12:54 PM - Arun M: So, i would say, every now and then, we should force-shed this excess baggage
5/10/20, 12:55 PM - Arun M: i guess this explanation will do for now.. it has become long already..
5/10/20, 2:52 PM - Arun M: that's bang on da.. enakkum athaan thonuchu.. its the yearning for change that is the need of the hour. Knowledge is there in excess ;)

5/11/20, 5:10 AM - Arun M: Yes Reddy, if we go back to compulsive eating again, you will end up with the same issues and then you will keep alternating. But practically, what tends to happen is 1. It takes a lot of discipline to do make changes in diet for few months 2. Low carb gives more health benefits than just weight loss. These 2 points typically ensure that a relapse of compulsive eating is less likely
5/11/20, 5:10 AM - Arun M: So, ppl go back to a moderate diet later and continue
5/11/20, 5:13 AM - Arun M: It is not necessary to go low carb if we follow most points which I mentioned earlier
5/11/20, 5:16 AM - Arun M: Ha ha yes da, change should be as non-violent as a ripe fruit falling from a tree 😊
